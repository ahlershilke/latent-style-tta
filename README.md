# Latent Augmentation of Feature Statistics in Test-Time Augmentation

This is the repository for my master thesis project, conducted under the tutelage of the chair for Explainable Artificial Intelligence (xAI), University of Bamberg.
The goal was to develop an extension to the Domain Generalization technique MixStyle ("Domain Generalization with MixStyle", Zhou et al. (2021)) that explicitly stores domain-specific style information during training to enable latent augmentation during inference time.
