# Test-Time Data Augmentation using Latent Style Statistics for Enhanced Domain Generalization

This is the repository for my master thesis project, conducted under the tutelage of the chair for Explainable Artificial Intelligence (xAI), University of Bamberg.
The objective of this work was to develop a method for addressing the domain generalization problem under domain shift conditions by explicitly encoding domain-specific style information during training, thereby enabling latent space augmentation at inference time.
